Qbits:  db_2p5A_0p3rfree_reduced_reps_biounits 12591 entries.

These differ due to the threshold of resolution and rfree used in determining the initial structures that were fed through the pipeline of biological assembly generation, clustering via mmSeqs2, and other filters that Nick used to create the Q-BITS database.  For the first database you listed, a resolution cutoff of 2.8Å and an rfree cutoff of 0.35 was used, which led to a larger database than the second case, in which a stricter resolution cutoff of 2.5 Å and rfree cutoff of 0.3 were used.
