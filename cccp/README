CCCP (Coiled-Coil Crick Parameterization) is an open-source suite for 
fitting optimal Crick parameters to protein backbones and generating 
ideal coiled-coil backbones from Crick parameters.

The Accommodation Index Analizer is a program that detects and
classifies local structural perturbations in coiled coils (e.g., insertions
and deletions) by using local Crick parameter fits.
