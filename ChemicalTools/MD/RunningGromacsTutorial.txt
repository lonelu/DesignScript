Gromacs Tutorials: http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/

1. Source things required to run gromacs in command line on DeGrabo:

source /cm/shared/apps/amber/amber18.17/amber.sh
source /cm/shared/apps/gromacs/2018.8_cuda8_gcc5/bin/GMXRC
source /cm/shared/apps/gromacs/2018.8_cuda10_gcc6/bin/GMXRC

2. Prepare the input pdb file:

gmx pdb2gmx -f input.pdb -o input_processed.gro -water spc #water has many options but this is a standard one

select option 6 for the forcefield "AMBER99SB-ILDN protein" as a standard choice

at bottom of newly generated topol.top file you should see all the elements of your pdb (i.e., protein and ions currently)

can use the editconf file

gmx pdb2gmx -f input_processed.gro -o input_processed.pdb -water spc

3. Generate the box around your protein: 

gmx editconf -f input_processed.gro -o input_newbox.gro -c -d 1.0 -bt dodecahedron 

Check the strcture to make sure the metal binding is correct.
gmx editconf -f input_newbox.gro -o input_newbox.pdb

-f is the input gro and should come from the above command
-o is the output gro and will be used in next command
dodecahedron is the most space efficient shape
d 1.0 gives at least one angstrom of space to the edge

4. Solvate the box around your protein:

gmx solvate -cp input_newbox.gro -cs spc216.gro -o input_solv.gro -p topol.top

-cp is the input gro and comes from above command
-cs brings in the info for the water and is built in to the program
-o is the output gro and will be needed for next command
-p indicates that you can overwrite the topol.top file. this will also generate old files that start with a hashtag

5. Generate the tpr file:

gmx grompp -f min.mdp -c input_solv.gro -p topol.top -o ions.tpr

-f you need to generate a min.mdp file in order to run. key are the integrator, emstep, emtol, and nsteps, at this stage most parameter sets will work
-c is the .gro file you generated above
-p topol.top again overwrites this file
-o ions.tpr will generate this file needed for next step

6. Add ions in to your system to neutralize

gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o input_solv_ions.gro -p topol.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral

-s is the input file you generated above
-o is the new gro file with ions added
-p topol.top will again be overwritten
-pname is the positive ion name (element name in all capitols, above is sodium)
-nname is the negative ion name (element name in all capitols, above is chloride)
-neutral gives you ions until neutral, you can also add ions to generate a certain molarity (i.e., 100 mM, in that case you need to know box size)

7. minimize and run md:

you could continue next steps in the command line or you could allow to run on the gpu with a slurm submission

to run on slurm use the sub_prep.script


# sbatch sub_prep.script
# sbatch sub_md.script
# squeue
